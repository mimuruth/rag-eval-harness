{"doc_id":"ai-001","title":"Azure OpenAI quota limits","text":"Azure OpenAI enforces token-per-minute and request-per-minute quotas per model deployment. If a client exceeds these limits, the service may respond with HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). Applications should implement retry with exponential backoff and consider reducing tokens or using a smaller model when appropriate."}
{"doc_id":"ai-002","title":"Prompt size and token cost","text":"The total cost and latency of LLM calls are influenced by prompt and response token counts. Reducing prompt size, summarizing context, and caching repeated responses can lower cost. Streaming responses can improve perceived latency for end users."}
{"doc_id":"rag-001","title":"RAG grounding failures","text":"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can hallucinate when retrieved documents are irrelevant, incomplete, or not provided clearly in the prompt. Improvements include better chunking, metadata filtering, hybrid search, and forcing the model to cite evidence from retrieved context."}
{"doc_id":"rag-002","title":"Chunking strategy basics","text":"Chunking splits source documents into smaller passages for retrieval. Too-small chunks can lose context; too-large chunks can reduce retrieval precision. Use overlap and include metadata such as source, section, and timestamps to improve relevance and traceability."}
{"doc_id":"net-001","title":"Private Endpoint DNS resolution","text":"When Private Endpoints are enabled, clients must resolve service FQDNs to private IP addresses. Missing private DNS zone links or incorrect DNS forwarding can cause name resolution failures. Verify DNS resolution from the client environment and ensure the correct private DNS zones are linked to the VNet."}
{"doc_id":"id-001","title":"Managed Identity access patterns","text":"Managed identities must be granted the correct permissions to access downstream resources such as Key Vault, Storage, or Azure AI Search. Misconfigured RBAC or missing permissions can cause authentication failures even when the identity is enabled on the app."}
{"doc_id":"sec-001","title":"Key Vault secret access failures","text":"Key Vault access can fail if the managed identity lacks secret permissions or if network rules block access (e.g., Private Endpoint misconfiguration). If an app uses Key Vault references, failures may appear as missing configuration values or runtime initialization errors."}
{"doc_id":"ops-001","title":"Observability for AI apps","text":"Production AI applications should log prompt versions, request IDs, latency, token usage, and retrieval metadata. This enables debugging, cost monitoring, and regression analysis. Avoid logging sensitive content; redact or hash where appropriate."}
{"doc_id":"eval-001","title":"Why evaluation is required","text":"LLM outputs can change due to prompt edits, model version changes, or retrieval differences. A repeatable evaluation harness with fixed test sets and metrics helps detect regressions before deployment and provides evidence of improvements."}
{"doc_id":"agent-001","title":"Tool calling reliability","text":"Agents that call tools should validate inputs and outputs, enforce schemas, and implement timeouts and retries. Tool failures should be handled gracefully to avoid partial or misleading answers."}
