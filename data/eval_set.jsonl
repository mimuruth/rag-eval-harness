{"id":"q-001","question":"Why might an Azure OpenAI request return HTTP 429 errors?","expected":"HTTP 429 errors commonly occur when token-per-minute or request-per-minute quotas are exceeded. Applications should implement retry with exponential backoff and consider reducing token usage.","must_include":["quota","retry"],"must_not_include":["increase temperature"]}
{"id":"q-002","question":"What are common causes of grounding failures in RAG systems?","expected":"Grounding failures happen when the retrieved documents are irrelevant, incomplete, or poorly chunked. Improving chunking, filtering, and retrieval quality helps reduce hallucinations.","must_include":["retrieved","documents"],"must_not_include":["model bug"]}
{"id":"q-003","question":"Why might Key Vault references fail in an Azure application?","expected":"Key Vault references may fail if the managed identity lacks permission to read the secret or if network access is blocked due to Private Endpoint or DNS misconfiguration.","must_include":["managed identity","permission"],"must_not_include":["store secrets in code"]}
{"id":"q-004","question":"What data should you capture for observability in an enterprise AI app?","expected":"Capture prompt version, request ID, latency, token usage, and retrieval metadata. Avoid logging sensitive content and apply redaction where needed.","must_include":["latency","token"],"must_not_include":["log all secrets"]}
{"id":"q-005","question":"How can you reduce LLM cost without breaking functionality?","expected":"Reduce prompt size, summarize context, cache repeated responses, and consider routing simpler tasks to smaller models. Track token usage to validate savings.","must_include":["reduce","cache"],"must_not_include":["ignore tokens"]}
{"id":"q-006","question":"Why do Private Endpoints often cause DNS-related connectivity issues?","expected":"Private Endpoints require correct private DNS zone configuration so service hostnames resolve to private IPs. Missing zone links or incorrect DNS forwarding commonly causes name resolution failures.","must_include":["DNS","private"],"must_not_include":["disable private endpoint"]}
{"id":"q-007","question":"What makes tool calling in agents reliable in production?","expected":"Reliable tool calling requires schema validation, timeouts, retries, and clear error handling so tool failures do not produce misleading outputs.","must_include":["schema","timeouts"],"must_not_include":["always trust tool output"]}
{"id":"q-008","question":"Why do LLM outputs change even if you did not change your code?","expected":"Outputs can change due to model updates, prompt edits, retrieval differences, or configuration changes like temperature. A fixed evaluation set helps detect regressions.","must_include":["evaluation","regressions"],"must_not_include":["LLMs are deterministic"]}
