q-001,Why might an Azure OpenAI request return HTTP 429 errors?,HTTP 429 errors commonly occur when token-per-minute or request-per-minute quotas are exceeded. Applications should implement retry with exponential backoff and consider reducing token usage.,,0.0,0,0.0,0.53,,,"ai-001,sec-001,ops-001"
q-002,What are common causes of grounding failures in RAG systems?,"Grounding failures happen when the retrieved documents are irrelevant, incomplete, or poorly chunked. Improving chunking, filtering, and retrieval quality helps reduce hallucinations.",,0.0,0,0.0,0.33,,,"rag-001,sec-001,agent-001"
q-003,Why might Key Vault references fail in an Azure application?,Key Vault references may fail if the managed identity lacks permission to read the secret or if network access is blocked due to Private Endpoint or DNS misconfiguration.,,0.0,0,0.0,0.31,,,"sec-001,id-001,ai-001"
q-004,What data should you capture for observability in an enterprise AI app?,"Capture prompt version, request ID, latency, token usage, and retrieval metadata. Avoid logging sensitive content and apply redaction where needed.",,0.0,0,0.0,0.31,,,"ops-001,id-001,sec-001"
q-005,How can you reduce LLM cost without breaking functionality?,"Reduce prompt size, summarize context, cache repeated responses, and consider routing simpler tasks to smaller models. Track token usage to validate savings.",,0.0,0,0.0,0.29,,,"ai-002,rag-002,eval-001"
q-006,Why do Private Endpoints often cause DNS-related connectivity issues?,Private Endpoints require correct private DNS zone configuration so service hostnames resolve to private IPs. Missing zone links or incorrect DNS forwarding commonly causes name resolution failures.,,0.0,0,0.0,0.28,,,"net-001,id-001,sec-001"
q-007,What makes tool calling in agents reliable in production?,"Reliable tool calling requires schema validation, timeouts, retries, and clear error handling so tool failures do not produce misleading outputs.",,0.0,0,0.0,0.27,,,"agent-001,ops-001,eval-001"
q-008,Why do LLM outputs change even if you did not change your code?,"Outputs can change due to model updates, prompt edits, retrieval differences, or configuration changes like temperature. A fixed evaluation set helps detect regressions.",,0.0,0,0.0,0.28,,,"eval-001,agent-001,ai-002"
